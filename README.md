# crypto-explore
Understanding go's capabilities and how to use crypto in the go world.  I also want to add examples, benchmarks, and tests.

First, I am making a stupd implementation of an RSA algorithm.  No hashing, no arrays even, just integers. Completelyl
impractical, but hey, I'm only just learning how the damn thing works.
